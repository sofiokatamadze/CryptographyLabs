Signature Verification Explanation
=================================

When Bob decrypts 'signed_message.asc' using his private key, GPG automatically checks the embedded digital signature.

In this case, the output includes:
  gpg: Signature made Sat 26 Jul 2025 07:36:06 PM +04
  gpg:                using RSA key 7800BACEAD383754EF57B2BA625A9DE0ECD90621
  gpg: Good signature from "Alice (Alice Key) <alice@example.com>" [ultimate]

This means:
- The decrypted message was signed using Alice's private key, and
- The signature matches Alice's public key.

**How this validates the sender:**
- Only Alice's private key could have created this signature.
- Since Bob verified the signature using Alice's public key (imported earlier), he knows the message came from Alice and was not tampered with in transit.
- If the message or signature had been altered, GPG would have displayed a warning and marked the signature as "BAD".

**Conclusion:**
Digital signatures in PGP provide both authenticity (proving the sender's identity) and integrity (proving the message was not changed).
