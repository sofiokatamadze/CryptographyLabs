RSA vs AES Encryption

Performance:
- RSA encryption/decryption is significantly slower due to complex mathematical operations involving large prime number factorization.
- AES is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for encrypting large files or streaming data.

Use-cases:
- RSA is commonly used for encrypting small data (like symmetric keys or passwords), digital signatures, and key exchanges.
- AES is ideal for bulk encryption of files, database contents, messages, and general data at rest or in transit.

Common Practice:
- Combine RSA (for secure key exchange) and AES (for actual bulk encryption).
